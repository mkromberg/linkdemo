# linkdemo
This repository contains the same code that is used in the examples in the [Link documentation](https://dyalog.github.io/link/3.0/): a `myapp` folder which contains application code, and a `stats` folder containing a tiny "library" of statistical functions.

The two folders should strictly speaking be in separate repos because the example imagines that the libraray is managed by a different group and therefore imported rather than actively linked to. In the name of simplicity, both folders are collected together in one place for demonstration purposes.
